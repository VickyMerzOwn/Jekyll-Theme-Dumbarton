Alas, I'm back to updating this.
I'm a few blogs into my blogging goals.
Working on a few research projects of my own, while planning for next summer. Looking forward to work in a research lab outside of India for Summer '23.
Meanwhile, here are a few things:
- [Updated Resume](/assets/pdf/vitae.pdf) (Same doc as you'd get on clicking the link in the nav bar)
- [GSoC Certificate](/assets/pdf/completion_certificate_2022_contributor.pdf), [GSoC Acceptance Letter](/assets/pdf/acceptance_letter_2022_Vemuganti-Sesha%20Satvik.pdf), and [Verification Letter](/assets/pdf/verification_letter_2022_Vemuganti-Sesha%20Satvik.pdf)
- [Google Solution Challenge Certificate](/assets/pdf/SatvikVemuganti.pdf)

I have been wanting to do this for as long as I can remember. Writing blogs seems like the perfect opportunity to take some time to introspect on what I am doing every day and think about how I plan to achieve my goals. <br>

Currently, I am enjoying the freedom of my summer vacation, while steadily making an effort to use my time better than I did my last.<br>

The burden of coursework during the semester always makes me dream about the things I will do during the summer. Fuelled by food from my mother's hand, I want to have a go at "The C Programming Language" book. At present, my [proposal](/assets/pdf/GSoC'22-SWH-SatvikVemuganti-Mine%20Information%20from%20Archived%20Content-SUBMIT.pdf) to contribute to an Open Source Project during Google Summer of Code 2022 has been accepted and I'm excited about that. As my first research internship, I am also working remotely with supervisors from IIT-BHU. I am lucky to have some interesting work on UAV Security under [de.ci.phe.red](http://de.ci.phe.red) Labs, IIT Bhilai with [Dr. Dhiman Saha](http://www.dhimans.in), [Dr. Pabitra Pal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-pabitra-pal-03412888/?originalSubdomain=in) and [Chaitanya Bisht](https://cbisht.in). <br>

Then there is [OpenLake](https://openlake.vercel.app) for which I have developed a passion in the last few months. The idea of building and maintaining software that anyone around the world can access or contribute to, free of cost, struck a chord in me. While the reverberations of that chord are in me, I'd like to contribute to this community in our college. <br>

Work aside, I love my music. Been wanting to practice the guitar... so have to pick that up from last summer. <br>
I also enjoy reading novels. My last one, [MOSSAD](https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_aps_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&adId=A06123541GZ13BXDK7SX4&url=%2FMossad-Michael-Bar-Zohar%2Fdp%2F8184958455%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fcrid%3D1D6ZXNERV1DKL%26keywords%3Dmossad%26qid%3D1653433791%26sprefix%3Dmossad%252Caps%252C179%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26psc%3D1&qualifier=1653433791&id=5046568359961699&widgetName=sp_atf), was a gift from a friend. Will complete the book on habits that the library lent me before summer gets over. <br>
Planning on exercising regularly and having healthy sleep patterns. <br>

Then, I also wish to blog. My GSoC project will have its own set of articles, which folks at SWH shall kindly go through before it is published on my blog. I may blog on the color of my neighbor's pet's fur, the sports I'm following, or my understanding of the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a democratic society, but blog for sure I will.

```Cheers!```
