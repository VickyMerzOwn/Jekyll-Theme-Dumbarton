### Hi, I'm Satvik <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> 
Welcome to My Website! I am an undergraduate student pursuing my Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering from the Department of EECS at IIT Bhilai. I have recently fallen in love with the Science of Computers as a whole, but prior to that, I did enjoy tackling Mathematic problems and was always blown away by Physics. However, one thing I have never stopped feeling passionate about is the game of cricket. Always an avid sports-nut, as my friends call me, when the men in blue are on the field, I'm right in front of the telly. <br>
