## A Back Story

It was just after winter break last December when I picked up "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, off the GOALS bookshelf. Amidst the hustle and bustle of activity in the recreation room of Ena Hostel, IIT Bhilai, lies a piece of furniture whose glass sliding door is almost impossible to be labelled transparent thanks to the layer of dust gathered over it. We had just come out of quarantine, which was mandatory for students returning to campus in December. Shukla, a friendly face among many at IIT Bhilai, was the Secretary of GOALS (the college's General Oratory and Literary Society). He asked me, in his bid to promote readership among a batch of students who predominantly had their college online so far, to pick a book.

Several titles stood out. Notably 'Mein Kampf', 'A brief history of time', 'To kill a Monckingbird' and 'The Godfather' have been on my to-read list for as far as I can remember. With its sleek white cover, "The Power of Habit" stood out even though I had never heard of the book before. Could be because I was looking to mend my procrastination and ✌️cure✌️ my laziness... God knows I've failed and am the same, if not worse. However, I secretly believe it was my disgust of the hours I would spend devouring Netflix shows that got me to pick it up.

<br>
<br>
Since then, it's been a bumpy ride. Ironically, I tried making a habit of reading the book regularly and failed. I may cite that I am used to reading novels filled with fiction that stirs my imagination. But this is simply incorrect. The book was a habit I tried to force upon myself and this **never** works. 

So I got back to it a week into my summer break. In between, I devoured "Mossad: The Greatest Missions of The Israeli Secret Service", a birthday gift, on my way home. That was easy as it was a book of thrilling but non-fictional tales. Once I started with my book on Habits, I didn't try to force myself to read it. Instead I warded of temptations to pick up other titles. It has taken some more time than usual but I have finished 70% of the book and have learnt more from this than any fictional masterpiece I've picked up.

This calls for a blog. A place where I can discuss what I have read, while attempting to give analogies to anecdotes in my life. A place where I can think of the things I'm doing wrong and try to make them right. A place to keep track of my growth from a self-help book.

## The Book

The book has been presented with utmost care in three parts. The systematic presentation of case studies and analyses warrants a fair bit of praise from any reader.
#### Prologue
<br>
Here, the author describes the transformation of Lisa Allen, from a 16-year-old obese, chainsmoking teenager with thousands of dollars in debt already to a lean and vibrant 34-year-old woman in the same job for just more than 3 years. How, the author poses a question, does such a transformation occur? How are some able to make this change while others struggle to and a few select others never have to? Lisa Allen believes that a switch in her mind tripped when she made some insane promises to herself on her return trip from Egypt. The author believes it is much more than this. The author was inspired to study the science of habits when it dawned on him, during his time as a newspaper reporter in Baghdad, that the US-Military is the biggest habit-formation exercises in history.[^1]
