The last time I sat in front of my laptop like this, looking to clear some doubts by writing, was in May of last year. I felt most of the content was not safe to put publicly so I didn't push it. Hopefully, it is better this time on.

Trying to go in an organized manner, unlike how my life feels right now, I'll add the questions I want to answer in this paragraph. Who am I? Why am I writing this blog? Who should and shouldn't read this blog? Why should you read this blog? What is an existential crisis? Why are there existential crises? Why did I approach Dr. Saha? Why join GDSC (why learn development)? About my breakup, the status of my courses this semester

I'm Satvik. I've recently gone through a breakup (completely my fault, don't think I ended it well but I don't see how I could've done better,
right now at least). I've an insecure relationship with my phone, jumping at every notification it throws. I don't like it, but I do a lot of things 
that I don't like because I can't help it. What else? I am a CS student at IIT Bhilai (who likes to write the long-form to brag) but I don't know
what I want to do next so I put my nose into everything. This means, I am in a lot of things (find my PORs in my CV). Apart from those, I 
recently joined the Developer Student Club in my college and have applied to be part of a crypto lab (de.ci.phe.red). The former because I 
want to learn a lot more about building computer stuff and the latter because of a short story. I have a lot of passing fads that I don't
pursue as much as I would like to. I would like to spend more time on things, but end up procrastinating and wasting a lot of time.

Why am I writing this blog? I have been thinking of writing something to put on my website for some time now. I am just disturbed 
and trying to find some reasons. I recently broke up and was unable to give her reasons for ending it (I did give some but sleeping over 
them once was enough for me to realize they were just not right). I do a lot of things instinctively, intuitively. One may say that's unhealthy 
but it has helped me in the past and it doesn't seem in my nature to stop something unless it makes intuitive sense to the very least. Another 
reason for writing this blog is that I think of a lot of things, do a lot of things, and forget most of those things. I would like to keep a record
of at least some of the things that I felt are relevant for a while. 

Who shouldn't read this blog? If you don't know me, you're at the wrong place. If you know me, but you know or think that we are not close,
this blog is not for you. If you do think that we are close, think of you can answer this question: Which school did I complete my primary 
and secondary education from? And finally, none of that matters to me because I would like none of what I discuss in this blog to be
brought back to me. If I have written something that I haven't discussed with you, then I am certainly not comfortable discussing that with 
you. I sincerely don't know if I should apologize for that but it, indeed, is what it is. I am sure of one thing. This is going to my website. I am 
not sure if I'll share it with my near and dear. 

What is an existential crisis? "Existential crisis, also known as existential dread, are moments when individuals question whether their lives
have meaning, purpose, or value, and are negatively impacted by the contemplation."  Well, maybe I shouldn't blog, after all. But I will. 
"It may be commonly, but not necessarily, tied to depression or ..." You get the gist. Why do I think I have it? I don't think I am depressed.
I am not happy at the state of things in my life (you may say, who is? but this is my blog, so) Why am I not happy? I find things interesting
but I find it easier to just sit back and watch a movie or a video or meaninglessly scroll through social media. I find it difficult to think but I 
do know that when I do think about things, I can learn more about them and I do find it satisfying to have realized that I have learned 
something. The word may be lazy and it may be that I am too proud to say that I am lazy. I sit in classes these days finding myself drifting 
completely off what is being discussed. I find myself in a distant world than of the topic I am trying to make sense of in a book I am reading.

I find myself thinking about what my ex would say about something I am reading or someone I am speaking with or any general thing I am 
up to while being up to that thing. I am probably drifting off in my thoughts with every line I am writing but I really don't know how I can 
stop. I have made efforts to stop that and realized that I can't keep up those efforts for long. I have given up on those efforts feeling that
they were going in vain. And now I am giving up on giving up and writing this blog is an attempt towards that. If you feel I am not in the
right state of mind, please don't worry, I do know that I will do anything harsh or take un-explainable extreme steps.

People have suggested meditation but I do know that I will not be able to make a habit of that and will stop doing it the moment I don't feel
like it. Any sport or routine or activity for that matter, I don't think I will be able to keep it up for long. So I have stopped starting to do 
things that I am supposed to. This doesn't mean that I don't serve up myself to every opportunity that presents itself. I find myself wanting 
to do a lot of things but when it actually comes to doing them, I am unable to find the concentration it takes. This might be reason number 
one for me to end my relationship. I have done this before. I try to cut off all my distractions and I think that people demand time and time 
is a distraction. Every now and then I realize that my concentration levels are falling for the things that I would really like to do and I decide to
cut off on the things that may be causing it. In this process, the people close to me get hurt. Then I think, haven't I ever hurt my parents
before? I only know the answer to this but I can't explain why, yet. By the way, the answer is no.

As a part of this process of cutting off distractions, I think it is important to say less. This too, I break often, by uttering the most 
meaningless of things and regret this outbreak at a later time. So if you think that I am silent about things, well here is my justification :
I know that replying to every outbreak of yours, every rant, everything I disagree with will only get me more of those things or more of you
trying to justify things from your side. I don't care to listen to those things because I am least interested in talking about that subject. It may 
be that I was the one that broached the subject, which I regret in retrospect, but I have soon realized that thinking about the subject is no 
more than a distraction. Sometimes, it happens so that in remaining silent, I end up thinking about the subject more than I would like. This 
defeats my purpose of remaining silent. This could be reason number two. I am trying to keep less distraction by fooling myself that the 
people around me maybe the reason for my dissatisfaction. 
I believe strongly that this is, as a teacher from my past whom I highly regard would put it, a failure's philosophy. Yet, I find myself helpless
as I drift down that backwater brook.

My anxiety

Finally, coming to my breakup. I have furnished two reasons. However, at this point in time, I am uncertain about anything. I don't know
if I still have love for the only girl I have ever loved so deeply but I don't know yet that I don't have love for her. This was a thing I did very
instinctively and adamantly. Only God knows, I may want to get back with her later and she may not. To be very honest, I have wanted to, 
since this morning. However, this is very unstable of me and all I would like to do is think this out with clarity.  I will have to accept this, for 
the decision was mine. But it is also like the other things I do, unsure. 

Not thinking of things

From that, it may seem I'm going to be talking about my breakup a lot.

I am posting this blog after simply running a Grammarly check. There are some lines that I have just made a note of in-between as things I 
don't want to forget writing about. However, I have thought to myself not to give more than an hour to this and I think I have surpassed 
that. And I don't want to delete those as I will write a few more. 
Please feel free to discuss with me your thoughts on what I have said if you know this is intended for you.
